title: Disposition Table

# Disposition {#disposition}

Following [ICH E3 guidance](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E3_Guideline.pdf),
we need to summarize accounting of all patients who entered the study, in Section 10.1, Disposition of Patients.
The disposition of patients reports the numbers of patients who were randomized, and who entered and completed each phase of the study, as well as the reasons for all post-randomization discontinuations, grouped by treatment and by major reason (lost to follow-up, adverse event, poor compliance etc.). 

```{r, message = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
library(haven) # Read SAS data
library(dplyr) # Manipulate data
library(tidyr) # Manipulate data
library(r2rtf) # Reporting in RTF format
```

The first step is to read relevant datasets into R. 
For disposition table, all the required information is saved in the ADSL dataset.
We can use `haven` package to read the dataset.

```{r}
adsl <- read_sas("data-adam/adsl.sas7bdat")
```

We illustrate how to prepare a report data for a simplified disposition 
of patients table using variables below: 

- USUBJID: Unique subject identifier 
- TRT01P: Planed treatment
- TRT01PN: Planned treatment encoding
- DISCONFL: Discontinued from study flag
- DCREASCD: Discontinued from study reason 

```{r}
adsl %>%
  select(USUBJID, TRT01P, TRT01PN, DISCONFL, DCREASCD) %>%
  head(4)
```
In the code below, we calculated patients in the analysis population. 

```{r}
n_rand <- adsl %>%
  group_by(TRT01PN) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = TRT01PN,
    names_prefix = "n_",
    values_from = n
  ) %>%
  mutate(row = "Patients in population")
n_rand
```
In the code below, we calculate number and percentage of patients who discontinued the study. 

Here we use `formatC()` to customize the numeric value to be 1 decimal with fixed width of 5. 

```{r}
n_disc <- adsl %>%
  group_by(TRT01PN) %>%
  summarize(
    n = sum(DISCONFL == "Y"),
    pct = formatC(n / n() * 100,
      digits = 1, format = "f", width = 5
    )
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = TRT01PN,
    values_from = c(n, pct)
  ) %>%
  mutate(row = "Discontinued")

n_disc
```
In the code below, we calculate number and percentage of patients 
who completed/discontinued the study in different reasons. 

```{r}
n_reason <- adsl %>%
  group_by(TRT01PN) %>%
  mutate(n_total = n()) %>%
  group_by(TRT01PN, DCREASCD) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    pct = formatC(n / unique(n_total) * 100,
      digits = 1, format = "f", width = 5
    )
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = DCREASCD,
    names_from = TRT01PN,
    values_from = c(n, pct),
    values_fill = list(n = 0, pct = "  0.0")
  ) %>%
  rename(row = DCREASCD)

n_reason
```

In the code below, we calculate number and percentage of patients 
who complete the study. We split `n_reason` because we need to customize 
the row order of the table.

```{r}
n_complete <- n_reason %>% filter(row == "Completed")

n_complete
```
In the code below, we calculate number and percentage of patients 
who discontinued the study in different reasons. 
Here we use `paste0("    ", row)` to add some leading space for individual reasons for study discontinuation. 

```{r}
n_reason <- n_reason %>%
  filter(row != "Completed") %>%
  mutate(row = paste0("    ", row))

n_reason
```

Now we combined individual rows into the whole table for reporting purpose. 
`tbl_disp` is used as input for `r2rtf` to create final report. 

```{r}
tbl_disp <- bind_rows(n_rand, n_complete, n_disc, n_reason) %>%
  select(row, ends_with(c("_0", "_54", "_81")))

tbl_disp
```

We start to define the format of the output. We highlighted items that 
is not discussed in previous discussion.

`rtf_title` define table title. We can provide a vector for the title argument. 
Each value is a separate line. 
The format can also be controlled by providing a vector input in text format. 


```{r}
tbl_disp %>%
  
  # Table title
  rtf_title("Disposition of Patients") %>%
  
  # First row of column header
  rtf_colheader(" | Placebo | Xanomeline Low Dose| Xanomeline High Dose",
    col_rel_width = c(3, rep(2, 3))
  ) %>%
  
  # Second row of column header
  rtf_colheader(" | n | (%) | n | (%) | n | (%)",
    col_rel_width = c(3, rep(c(0.7, 1.3), 3)),
    border_top = c("", rep("single", 6)),
    border_left = c("single", rep(c("single", ""), 3))
  ) %>%
  
  # Table body
  rtf_body(
    col_rel_width = c(3, rep(c(0.7, 1.3), 3)),
    text_justification = c("l", rep("c", 6)),
    border_left = c("single", rep(c("single", ""), 3))
  ) %>%
  
  # Encoding RTF syntax
  rtf_encode() %>%
  
  # Save to a file
  write_rtf("tlf/tbl_disp.rtf")
```

In conclusion, the procedure to generate a AE summary table as shown in the above example is listed as follows:

- Step 1: Read data into R, i.e. `adsl`.
- Step 2: Count patients in the analysis population and name the dataset as `n_rand`.
- Step 3: Count the number and percentage of patients who discontinued the study, and name the dataset as `n_disc`.
- Step 4: Count the number and percentage of of patients who discontinued the study in different reasons, and name the dataset as `n_reason`.
format it by `r2rtf`.
- Step 5: Count the number and percentage of of patients who completed the study, and name the dataset as `n_complete`.
- Step 6: Rowly bind `n_rand`, `n_disc`, `n_reason` and `n_complete` and format it by `r2rtf`.
